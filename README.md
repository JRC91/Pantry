# Pantry

This is an app that keeps track of items in a pantry and suggests recipes for what you have.

To begin you MUST make a sign-up account, there's currently no localStorage usage. You can view the project on the following Heroku link.

This is still a work in progress, and I'm going to add:

-search bar
-adding in quantity information for the pantry and recipes
-conversion between pounds, grams, cups, and liters.
-nutritional and caloric information
-user adding ingredients into the database
-filtering by preference or allergies
-admin approval for ingredients and recipes
-keeping track of preservation of pantry items.
